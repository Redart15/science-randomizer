## Introduction
This is a mod for the game [Factorio](https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/).\
Factorio is a real-time strategy game where players must build and manage complex automated factories.

## Features
Randomizes the recipe for the science packs.
The recipes only use item that can be unlock with thr previous tier of item, thus making the game always complitable.

## Missing
- barrels of fluids
- fish
- water, steam
- used uranuim cells(maybe no unlockable)

## ToDo
- [ ] add settings
- [ ] make it compatable with other mods
- [ ] add option to toggle wood/fish or others, this will require getting mods
- [ ] add tierless to allow complete randomness(still completable)
